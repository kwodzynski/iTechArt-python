- ```Resources/text_to_parsing.txt``` file with text to be parsed
- one class ```ParsingTextMethods/TextParsing.py``` with methods for printing number of words and all of the words from ```text_to_parsing.txt``` file, calculating numbers of single words occurrences and printing all of sentences

- The script ```ImageProcessing``` requires install ```Pillow```. You can install that package in terminal using:
```

python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
```
- The script has been written in Python 3, so it does require Python in 3.x version installed

3. Open the terminal and type:
```

```
- if you use python 2.x and 3.x versions in parralel please use ```python3``` command instead
